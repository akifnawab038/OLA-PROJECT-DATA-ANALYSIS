# 📊 OLA Data Analyst Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing OLA ride booking data using **SQL** and creating interactive dashboards in **Power BI**. The goal is to derive insights about ride performance, customer behavior, revenue trends, and driver ratings to help make data-driven decisions.



## 🗂️ Dataset

* **Customer & Driver Ratings**
* **Payment Details**
* **Ride Completion & Cancellation Reasons**



## 🛠️ Tools Used

* **SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL)** for data querying and analysis.
* **Power BI** for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.



## 📌 SQL Tasks Completed

1. **Retrieve all successful bookings**

2. **Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type**

3. **Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers**

4. **List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides**

5. **Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues**
